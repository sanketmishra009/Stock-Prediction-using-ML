# Stock Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project focused on predicting stock prices using various machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze historical stock data and create predictive models that provide insights into future stock price trends.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for stock price prediction
- Model evaluation and performance comparison

## Requirements

To set up the project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanketmishra009/Stock-Prediction-using-ML.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Stock-Prediction-using-ML
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to:
   - Preprocess data
   - Train machine learning models
   - Evaluate model performance

4. Run the scripts in the `src/` directory for automated workflows.

## Models Used

The project explores the following machine learning techniques:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks (if applicable)

## Results

- Performance metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) for each model are compared.
- Visualizations of actual vs. predicted stock prices are included.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporation of deep learning techniques (e.g., LSTM, GRU).
- Expansion to include sentiment analysis from financial news.
- Deployment of the predictive model as a web application.
